This is a work in progress for my Methods II Final at The Graduate Center CUNY.

The objective is to create a classifier to parse written plays, determine the protagonist, 
whether the protagnist dies, and whether the overall sentiment of the play is a tragedy, 
or whether the play has a tragic ending.

See the writeup for fuller details.

full_text_copy.py is the classifier
